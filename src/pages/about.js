              On Diwali 2018, a singular article planted a seed (pun intended)
              in the mind of a very passionate student from New Delhi. The
              article spoke about the rise in pollution levels due to the
              bursting of crackers and enabled the reader to reason the sitch on
              the lack of trees in the capital. A phone call to a fellow
              dendrophile, a compassionate friend and multiple endless
              long-drives led to what we would now like to introduce as Grey To
              Green. A work in progress for a year and a half now, Grey To Green
              aims to provide a platform and service which will equip anybody
              and everybody to adopt trees with the click of a button. Letâ€™s
              make this world a greener place. Together.
